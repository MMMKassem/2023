            <p align="justify">How do we connect the next billion users to the Internet? How do we capture high-resolution
pictures of the Earth, or enable massive-scale IoT across industries? How do we enable
high-capacity Internet in the remotest regions of the globe? Over the past decade, significant
reductions in satellite production and launch costs have opened up a new `space’ – access to
Low-Earth Orbits or LEO. Massive constellations from industry consisting of hundreds to tens of
thousands of low-flying satellites are being rolled out. The wide-scale LEO satellite deployment
and interest present a unique challenge and opportunity to bring reliable Internet connectivity to
the remotest regions of the Earth. As such, the research community needs the right tools to
explore various unforeseen opportunities (like global coverage, low-latency connectivity, and
high-resolution imagery) and challenges (like extreme mobility, bottlenecked downlinks, and
sparse ground infrastructure) that come with LEO deployments.</p>

            
            <p align="justify">Overall, LEO-NET aims to open new avenues for networking researchers to explore different
aspects of LEO constellation operation and performance and shape the state of LEO satellite
communication. We see multiple strong verticals in LEO – understanding the operation and
potential bottlenecks in rapidly growing LEO constellation offerings, novel network protocol
extensions that leverage the highly dynamic LEO links, applications like satellite imagery and
IoT, LEO compute, and several others. We expect strong submissions along all of these
verticals addressing many open challenges across the stack.</p>
