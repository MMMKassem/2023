		<p align="justify">Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication and networking is a rapidly growing field with
great potential for enabling new and innovative applications by providing low-latency,
high-bandwidth Internet connectivity globally. Massive-scale LEO deployments from industrial
players, such as Starlink, OneWeb, etc. have allowed wide-scale availability of LEO satellite
network access globally but their network remains to operate as a black box. However,
considering the state of LEO networking and constellation design is still in its infancy, we believe
that the unique challenges posed by the inherently dynamic LEO satellite architectures,
necessitate novel solutions in network architecture, protocol design, resource management,
along with several other verticals.</p>
		
            <p align="justify">LEONET 2023 invites submissions from researchers and practitioners in academia and industry
who are exploring the latest developments and open challenges in LEO satellite networks and
communications. We also welcome work-in-progress and position papers that present new
directions, highly original ideas, or have the potential to provoke insightful discussions during
the workshop. Whether you're an expert or a newcomer to the field, we encourage you to join us
		    and contribute to this exciting area of research.</p>
		    
	       		<p align="justify">As such, the scope of this workshop includes (but is not limited to) the following topics.<br/></p>
						
<ulx class="list-arrow-right" style="font-weight: 100;">

            </ulx>

            <br/>
            <p>Papers should contain original material and not be previously published or currently submitted for consideration elsewhere. All submissions will be judged by their technical merit and relevance to the workshop, based on reviews by the Technical Program Committee.</p>

            <p>Manuscripts must be submitted by using the HotCRP conference management system at <a href="https://leo-net23.hotcrp.com/" target=”_blank”>https://leo-net23.hotcrp.com/</a>. Prospective authors are encouraged to submit a single PDF file with all fonts embedded, using the ACM conference proceedings format (use the same PDF formatting guidelines as the main conference). Paper length is limited to six (6) pages (in two-column, 10-point format), all-inclusive (references, figures, etc.). Papers must include author names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the program committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM WiNTECH proceedings and will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. All papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award.</p>
